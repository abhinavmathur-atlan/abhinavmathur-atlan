👋 Hey there! I'm Abhinav, a Software Engineer Intern who loves turning ☕ into Python code and ideas into AI magic!  
🚀 Passionate about Machine Learning, NLP, and building cool things with FastAPI & MCP tools.  
💡 Research excites me—especially anything in the AI/ML universe.  
🎨 If my code had a color, it'd be teal: calm, creative, and a little bit quirky.  
🤖 Always up for new challenges, hackathons, and collaborating on awesome projects.  

Let's connect, collaborate, and make the future smarter (and a bit more teal)! 🦄
